`abstract`
No implementation, requires child classes to implement this method

`virtual`
Give permission (to child class) to provide alternative implementation of method

`override`
Method overrides `virtual`, `abstract`, or  `override` methods

`new`
Like `override` but this method is not related to the method in base class (providing a "new" method) (considered as a bad idea)
