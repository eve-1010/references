A relatively high-level way to structure and conceptualize the implementation of a computer program. A programming language can be classified as supporting one or more paradigms.

#### Imperative programming
Code directly controls execution flow and state change.
- Procedural: Organized as procedures that call each other.
	- Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL)
	- Formula Translation (FORTRAN)
	- Algorithmic Language (ALGOL)
	- Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC)
	- C
- Object-oriented: Organized as objects that contain both data structure and associated behavior.
	- C++
	- Python
	- PHP
	- Java
	- C#

#### Declarative programming
Code declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it.
- Functional: A desired result is declared as the value of a series of function evaluations.
- Logic: A desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules.
- Reactive: A desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change.
