#### Bridges
Similar to switch, but has fewer ports. (Or, switch is a multi port bridge) Bridge provides link between two networks.

Before switch become inexpensive, large Ethernet networks used hubs to connect computers and other devices, and used a few bridges to break up large collision domains. Now that switches are common, bridging devices are not seen much anymore.

A thing useful about bridges is that they can connect two different types of network (eg Cat-5e and fibre-optic) (switches are capable of this too)

#### SFP Ports and Uplinks
